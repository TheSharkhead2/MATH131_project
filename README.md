# MATH131 Final Project
This is my final project for MATH131 (Mathematical Analysis) at Harvey Mudd College. 
It is in the form of a Julia Pluto notebook so to run the notebook to use the interactive elements you first need to start a Julia REPL with `julia` in the command line. Then run: 
```julia
import Pluto
Pluto.run()
```
This should open up Pluto in your browser and you can open the project from there. You may need to install the packages `LinearAlgebra` and `Plots` which can be done by openning the REPL, pressing the closing square bracket (`]`), and then running `add LinearAlgebra` and `add Plots`.
